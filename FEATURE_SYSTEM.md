## API Endpoints

### Resource Routes
- `GET /admin/features` - List all features
- `GET /admin/features/create` - Show create form
- `POST /admin/features` - Store new feature
- `GET /admin/features/{id}` - Show feature details
- `GET /admin/features/{id}/edit` - Show edit form
- `PUT /admin/features/{id}` - Update feature
- `DELETE /admin/features/{id}` - Delete feature

### Additional Routes
- `POST /admin/features/{id}/toggle` - Toggle feature status (AJAX)
- `POST /admin/features/update-order` - Update feature order (AJAX)

## Helper Methods

### FeatureHelper Class

```php
// Get all active features
$features = FeatureHelper::getActiveFeatures();

// Get all features (active and inactive)
$features = FeatureHelper::getAllFeatures();

// Get a specific feature
$feature = FeatureHelper::getFeature($id);

// Get feature count
$count = FeatureHelper::getFeaturesCount();

// Get active features count
$count = FeatureHelper::getActiveFeaturesCount();

// Clear cache
FeatureHelper::clearCache();

// Get frontend-ready data
$data = FeatureHelper::getFeaturesForFrontend();

// Check if features exist
$hasFeatures = FeatureHelper::hasActiveFeatures();

// Get statistics
$stats = FeatureHelper::getFeatureStats();
```

## Frontend Integration

The features component automatically displays features from the database. If no features exist, it falls back to default hardcoded features.

### Using Features in Views

```php
use App\Helpers\FeatureHelper;

// Get features for display
$features = FeatureHelper::getFeaturesForFrontend();

// Check if features exist
if (FeatureHelper::hasActiveFeatures()) {
    // Display features
}
```

## Icon Management

### Supported Icons
The system supports FontAwesome icons. Common icons include:

- `fas fa-university` - University/Education
- `fas fa-passport` - Travel/Visa
- `fas fa-file-alt` - Documents
- `fas fa-dollar-sign` - Money/Scholarships
- `fas fa-plane` - Travel
- `fas fa-headset` - Support
- `fas fa-graduation-cap` - Graduation
- `fas fa-globe` - International
- `fas fa-users` - People
- `fas fa-chart-line` - Growth/Progress

### Icon Preview
The admin forms include real-time icon preview functionality that shows how the icon will appear on the feature card.

## Validation Rules

### Create/Update Feature
- `title`: required, string, max:255
- `description`: required, string, max:500
- `icon`: required, string, max:100
- `order`: nullable, integer, min:0
- `is_active`: boolean

## Caching

The system uses intelligent caching to improve performance:

- Feature data is cached for 1 hour
- Cache is automatically cleared when features are created, updated, or deleted
- Individual feature cache is cleared when specific features are modified

## Security Features

- CSRF protection on all forms
- Input validation and sanitization
- Admin authentication required
- SQL injection prevention

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- Drag-and-drop functionality requires JavaScript
- Responsive design works on mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Icons not displaying**: Check if FontAwesome is loaded and icon class is correct
2. **Drag-and-drop not working**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled
3. **Cache issues**: Run `FeatureHelper::clearCache()` or clear application cache
4. **Validation errors**: Check field requirements and character limits

### Performance Tips

- Use appropriate icon classes
- Keep descriptions concise (under 500 characters)
- Monitor cache performance
- Use meaningful titles

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multiple icon libraries support
- [ ] Custom icon upload
